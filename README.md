# Tooling/Sass

I used my first module 1 project to demonstrate Sass.

The 5 aspects of Sass I used are:
   - Variables for colors, also used in a mixin function.
   - Inherit on h3, extended h2 styling and overwrote some.
   - Created a mixin function with on variable for flex styling and used it on two elements.
   - Nested styles on multiple elements.
   - Created two sub scss files to simplify and imported them to the main scss file
